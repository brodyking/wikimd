<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src='src/img/wikimd.png' style='width: 100%;'>

WikiMD lets you create a wiki site in minutes with relative ease. All you have to do is download the source code, start your web server, and your site is already running! No need to install anything or create any databases! This is because all the content is stored in .md files that can be found in /data/

### Prerequisites

You will need a basic web server that has PHP enabled on it.

## Documentation

This section of the README is all the documentation that is provided for SJS.

### How to create a page

To create a page, just make a new file in the /data/ folder. Make sure it is a .md file. WikiMD uses showdownjs to convert it to HTML. If you want to visit the page, simply use the ?page= param in the url. Here is a example:

https://example.com/index.php?page=about

#### Configuration
Configuration can be done inside of the /data/conf.js file.
There are only 4 things you can change. The site name, description, nav content, and motd. The motd will remain hidden if you set it to ""
