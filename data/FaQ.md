### Why does the site require php?

I did most of the creation of this site in JavaScript because I am most comfortable with it. The only thing I used PHP for was the URL's. If you want to goto the about page, you type <code>?page=About</code>. I need php to do this. You can do a workaround with #'s but it is really weird and PHP just made it easier.

### How do I use HTML in the page files?

HTML is natively supported, so just start typing out elements if you want! Note that you cannot use markdown once you are inside of a element.

### Will there ever be theme support?

Probably not. If you want to create your own theme, then just edit the css file. This is supposed to be super lightweight so I don't wanna add too many things.

### Why are my page changes not showing?

Pages are cached by the browser, so until you restart your browser or clear your cache, the old page will remain the one showing.
