## The Initial Goal

This website was created to help make wikis easier to make. Some of the reasons we thought other wikis were too difficult were:

* Syntax on mediawiki is too confusing
* Backups and configuration is hard for people who cant program
* Mediawiki requires a database

## Our changes

Here are the things we changed to make our platform easier and better.

* Syntax is just markdown with optional HTML
* Configuration is in one file with documentation next to it all
* All pages are stored in text files making them easy to backup

Setup is as easy as downloading the source code and opening index.php!
